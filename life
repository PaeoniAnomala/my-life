Unfortunately, the provided contexts do not directly relate to calculating the square of a planet. They discuss programming for mathematical operations and calculating planetary positions, but not the square of a planet. However, based on the contexts, here's a combined answer that demonstrates how to calculate the square of a number in different programming languages:

To calculate the square of a number in C, you can use the following function [source](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/c-program-to-calculate-square-of-a-number/):

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int Calculate_Square(int Number)
{
    return Number * Number;
}

int main()
{
    int number, Square;
    printf(" \n Please Enter an Integer: ");
    scanf("%d",&number);
    Square = Calculate_Square(number);
    printf(" \n Square of %d is: %d", number, Square);
    return 0;
}
```

To calculate the square of a number in Python, you can use the following code [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-profram-to-calculate-square-of-a-given-number/):

```python
def square(num):
    return num * num

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Square of", num, "is", square(num))
```

These code snippets demonstrate how to calculate the square of a number in C and Python, respectively. However, calculating the square of a planet would require a different approach, such as astronomical calculations and orbital mechanics, which are not covered in the provided contexts.
